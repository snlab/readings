Programming framework
- Akka: a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and 
  fault tolerant applications on the JVM.
  Approach: Akka creates a layer between the actors and the underlying system such that actors simply need to process messages. All the complexity of creating and scheduling threads, receiving and dispatching messages, and handling race conditions and synchronization, is relegated to the framework to handle transparently.
